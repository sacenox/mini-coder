# TODO

- Reasoning blocks should use our colors library for italic styling.
- Assistant responses are no longer rendered with highlighted markdown syntax. It's just plain text with no coloring. Let's condider markdown rendering libraries and their performance costs and completly rethink our approach. We want to keep our fast output above all, even if that means no markdown rendering.

## UI Audit

- We need to revise all of our output to ensure consistency, **performance** and correctness.
- Ensure we have a good styled output that is clear to the user, refactor as needed.
- Ensure we have propper hierchy in output, and the different types of output are clearly distinguishable for the user, using styles and whitespace.
- Ensure proper spinner functionality, that follow up messages don't rended inline and that is doesn't break anything.

## LSP Diagnostics (not very important, with strong linting this is not as necessary, but we should implement asap)

We should have a closed loop feedback for LSP diagnostics on edits/reads.

This could potentially be a very big slowdown, waiting for updated diagnostics every edit. This also has bias downsides, stale diagnostics confuse the LLM, and can cause negative distractions.

We need to do research first and find an approach that fits the current shell-first architecture without the performance penalties. Needs brainstorming

## Deferred fixes

- Subagent and shell tools are very similar, shell could do what subagent does without changes. This could be leveraged to reduce code. Subagent process runner is used for custom commands that fork context as well, there will need to be refactored.
- `/_debug` hidden command that snapshots recent logs/db and creates a report in the cwd. For dev mostly but available to all. Do not list it anywhere, only documented here and in the code itself.
